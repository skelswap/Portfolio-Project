    <p>Hello, I'm Gavin Davis. I am a 17-year-old rising senior in high school, and I am excited to see what my future
      brings.</p>

  <div class="fleximg">
    <p>Some of my main interests and hobbies are playing video games, playing the piano, coding, and spending time with
      my family members, friends, and pets. I have also taken 5 years of French, and have a strong interest in the
      countries France and Japan because of their cultures and contributions to the world.</p>

    <p>I have loved technology my entire life, and I hope to go to either Purdue or IU Bloomington and major in Computer
      Science for college. In the future I hope to have a career as a software developer, and potentially a game
      developer.</p>

    <p>I am a member of my school's robotics team, where I have learned so much about STEM and engaged in a lot of fun
      hands on engineering as well as coding with some of my best friends. I have also taken two years of Computer
      Science classes in high school, including AP, where I have practiced Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to varying
      degrees.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, I am interning this summer through the Nextech Catapult program where I'm making this
      website, practicing coding, hearing from industry professionals, going on tours with tech companies, and meeting a
      ton of very cool people.</p>
