    <h2>HIREME PAGE</h2>
    <p>
      My <strong>first coding project in</strong> the <strong>Nextech Catapult</strong> program was this "HireMe" page
      made based on information from Meimei Liu about herself. You can view the website and its code <a
        href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=7547717e-6034-4b42-8d63-aeb5bde2cdec" class="aless">here</a>.

    <h2>BUSINESS CARD</h2>
    <p>Also during my time <strong>with Nextech</strong>, I designed this business card which portrays my contact and
      <strong>basic information in a sleek way</strong>.

    <p>The final project that I completed <strong>with Nextech</strong> was this prototype for an app that would serve
      my local community. It is called <strong>"Budgeting for Benevolence"</strong> aka <strong>B4B</strong> and is
      designed to help people budget some of their money to <strong>help those in need</strong>. (not finished)</p>

    <p>
      Prior to Nextech, the <strong>robot</strong> that my team made <strong>last year in robotics</strong> was also a
      huge tech project of mine. I had a large hand in its development, specifically helping with things like coding the
      robot's <strong>sensors</strong> and wiring its many <strong>circuit boards</strong>. It eventually became able to
      <strong>drive, shoot, and climb</strong> across bars in competitions.
